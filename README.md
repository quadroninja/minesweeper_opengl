# minesweeper_opengl

A minesweeper game I made at my leisure.

Technologies used: C, OpenGL

# Controls: 

Left click to open a cell

Right click to put a flag on a cell

ESC - quit the game

SPACE - restart the game

# How to play

All the code is stored in one file - "main.c"

To play, download the "minesweeper.exe" file and launch it

IMPORTANT: "config.cfg" file should be in one directory with the executable

You can change the size of the board and number of mines by editing "config.cfg"
