# minesweeper_opengl
A minesweeper game I made at my leisure.

Technologies used: C, OpenGL

Controls: 
Left click to open a cell

Right click to put a flag on a cell

ESC - quit the game

SPACE - restart the game


All the code is stored in one file - "main.c"

To play, download the "minesweeper.exe" file and launch it
